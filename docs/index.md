# ReadStore Command Line Interface (CLI)

The ReadStore Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for uploading and managing your genomic data. With the ReadStore CLI, you can upload FASTQ files directly to the ReadStore database, as well as access and manage Projects, Datasets, metadata, and attachment files with ease.

The CLI can be run from your shell or terminal and is designed for seamless integration into data pipelines and scripts, enabling efficient automation of data management tasks. This flexibility allows you to integrate the ReadStore CLI within any bioinformatics application or pipeline, streamlining data uploads, access, and organization within ReadStore.

By embedding the ReadStore CLI in your bioinformatics workflows, you can improve efficiency, reduce manual tasks, and ensure your data is readily accessible for analysis and collaboration.
